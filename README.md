# Fractal Programs in C++ ‚ú®üñ•Ô∏è

This repository contains several C++ programs for generating fractals. Fractals are fascinating mathematical structures that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. Each program in this repository generates a different type of fractal (Koch's Curve/Snowflake, Sierpinski's triangle, Binary Tree) using various algorithms and techniques. The fractals included are:

1. **Binary Tree Fractal üå≥**
   - File: `Binary Fractal Tree.cpp`
   - Description: This program generates a tree fractal using recursion. The fractal resembles a tree branching pattern.

2. **Koch Snowflake Fractal ‚ùÑÔ∏è**
   - File: `Koch's Flake.cpp`
   - Description: This program generates a Koch snowflake fractal using recursion. The fractal consists of a triangle with smaller triangles recursively attached to each side.

3. **Sierpinski's Triangle ‚ñ≤**
   - File: `Sierpinski's Triangle.cpp`
   - Description: This program generates a triangle fractal using recursion. The fractal is formed by repeating a specific pattern of triangles.

4. **Koch Curve Fractal üåÄ**
   - File: `Koch Curve.cpp`
   - Description: This program generates a Koch curve fractal using recursion. The fractal is formed by repeatedly dividing line segments into smaller segments and adding equilateral triangles on each segment.

## Requirements

To compile and run these programs, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Graphics library (e.g., WinBGIm)

Enjoy exploring the mesmerizing world of fractals! üåå
